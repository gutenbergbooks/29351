<h1>PUNCH,<br />

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

<h2>VOLUME 147</h2>

<hr class="full" />

<h2><span class="smcap">December</span> 2, 1914.</h2>

<hr class="full" />

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>, we hear, has had much pleasure in not bestowing the Iron
Cross on Herr <span class="smcap">Maximilien Harden</span>, the editor of <i>Zukunft</i>, who, in a
recent article, suggested that the Germans should give up the pretence
that they did not begin the War.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cecil Chisholm</span>, in his biography of our Commander-in-Chief, draws
attention to the fact that both Sir <span class="smcap">John French</span> and General <span class="smcap">Joffre</span> are
square men. This, no doubt, accounts for the difficulty the enemy has in
getting round them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The author also mentions that the subject of his biography is known as
"Lucky French," though few persons understand the full appropriateness
of the epithet. It was Sir <span class="smcap">John Luck</span> who first gave him a chance of
distinguishing himself.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Before Christmas," says a German journal, "Londoners will have become
familiar with the spectacle of seeing their public buildings guarded by
German blue-jackets." This, of course, must refer to the interior of our
prisons.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We hear that as a result of the raid by British airmen on the Zeppelin
base at Friedrichshaven, the place has now been placarded with notices
announcing that foreign aeroplanes are <i>verboten</i> there.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is announced that the proposal at Lewisham to change the name of
Berlin Road has been rejected by the residents. This is unfortunate, as
the only effect can be to put fresh heart into the Germans.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Russians having objected to being called a steam roller, the London
and North Western Railway have tactfully taken their fast engine
"Teutonic" and re-christened her "The Tsar."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Russians succeeded, a few days ago, in catching the <i>Goeben</i>
napping. Apparently the motto of the Turkisch Navy is "Let lying dogs
sleep."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A writer in <i>The Daily Chronicle</i> suggests that cats, with their
marvellous homing instincts, might be used for the carriage of messages
in the same way as pigeons. Not quite in the same way, perhaps; though
cases of flying cats have occurred. We know one, for instance, that flew
at a dog only the other day.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Eye-witness</span>" has remarked that the Germans in France are now equipped
with a gun which is quite silent. As a result of this statement a number
of men who had hitherto held back as being subject to headaches are now
rushing to enlist.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The advertisement of a new rifle gallery in Dublin runs as
follows:&mdash;"Learn to shoot at the Dublin Rifle School. The object is to
teach every man to shoot irrespective of political views." The old order
changeth. Formerly, no doubt, the rifles were sighted in one way for
Unionists and in another for Nationalists.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The watchmaking industry in Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, has, it is
stated, already suffered a loss of &pound;700,000 since the outbreak of the
war. This is attributed entirely to the competition of the Watch on the
Rhine.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>With reference again to the Silent Guns which the Germans claim to have
invented, it is only fair to point out that, before they were heard of,
English artillery-men had silenced many of the noisy ones.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<center>"FREE PASSES AND OVER-CROWNING."</center>

<p class="author"><i>Evening Standard.</i></p>

<p>There was some excuse for this misprint, for the offence complained of
took place at the Coronation Picture Palace.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Caution.</span>&mdash;The members of the Old Boys Corps simply hate being called
"Old B.C.s."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Plucky little Wales again! Russia may have her Przemysl, but it
transpired in certain police-court proceedings last week that Glamorgan
has her Ynysybwl. We would suggest that the competition should now stop.</p>

<h2>THE RECRUITING PROBLEM SOLVED.</h2>

<p>The recruiting problem would surely be solved easily if Lord <span class="smcap">Kitchener</span>
would send for <i>Captain Desmond, V.C.</i>, and his legions from Lahore. It
will be remembered that in a polo tournament at that military station
<i>Captain Desmond</i> and his team reached the final after "they had fought
their way, inch by inch, through eight-and-twenty matches." (Ch. XVI.,
<i>Captain Desmond, V.C.</i>, by <span class="smcap">Maud Diver</span>.) If we generously assume that
the hero's team played in the only tie in the first round the rest being
byes&mdash;we arrive at the result that there were 268,435,457 teams or
1,073,741,828 men playing. Might not just a small percentage of these,
if brought over to France, decide the issue at once in favour of the
Allies? Some of the four or five billion ponies might also be utilised
for remounts and for transport. Nor should the committee which
successfully managed this tournament be lost sight of. They showed a
power of organisation which could scarcely fail to be of use now at the
War Office.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Rosa pulled off her hat as she spoke, throwing it carelessly on the
bed, and she laughed nosily."&mdash;<i>Ottawa Citizen.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This is generally supposed to be an American habit.</p>

<hr />

<p>A censored letter from a correspondent at the Front tells us that the
most popular song with our Troops is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"It's a long way to &mdash;&mdash;,</p>
<p class="i2">It's a long way to go;</p>

<p class="i2">It's a long, long way to &mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">But my heart's right &mdash;&mdash;."</p>
</div></div>

<p>It will be interesting to hear further details as soon as they can be
divulged without giving the position away to the Enemy.</p>

<h2>HISTORY'S REPETITIONS.</h2>

<blockquote><p>[<i>It may be interesting to compare modern war items with some which
have been culled from our own contemporary records of the past.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>From <i>The Early British Weekly, circ.</i> 50 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Chief Druid's Fund to provide woad for our gallant troops at the
Front continues to progress.</p>

<p>Tried yesterday for flint-and-steel signalling to the enemy, a Roman spy
was convicted and axed.</p>

<p>News from Rome continues to show that the capital of the enemy is
growing very uneasy. A force of special lictors has been enrolled to
keep order in the event of a popular rising.</p>

<p>An account of the fighting by an Eye-Witness with the Headquarters of
<span class="smcap">Cassivelaunus</span> appears on another page.</p>

<p>From <i>The Saxon Chronicle</i>, 878 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King Alfred</span> has given his patronage to a scheme for sending comforts to
our troops in the trenches. Contributions are already pouring in, and it
is said that the KING was particularly touched by a gift of
confectionery from the wife of a humble neatherd.</p>

<p>From <i>The Saxon Standard</i>, 1065 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Norman Lie Factory continues to try to frighten us by means of
invasion stories. The latest tale of terror is to the effect that a
great army is to be landed at Hastings before we know where we are. We
are to be crushed under the mailed fist of Normandy. The General Staff
of <span class="smcap">King Harold</span> can, we think, be trusted to deal with such
dangers&mdash;<i>when</i> they come.</p>

<hr />

<h2>UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.</h2>

<center>NO. IX.<br />

(<i>From General <span class="smcap">Von Bernhardi.</span></i>)</center>

<p>All-Highest War Lord,&mdash;To have received from you a letter written in
your own gracious and weapon-bearing hand is an honourable privilege,
under the weight of which many a General might have felt his knees
tremble, and I confess that I too, though used to your Majesty's
kindnesses, have not been unmoved.</p>

<p>Your Majesty asks me what I now think of this war of mine&mdash;I quote your
words&mdash;and goes on to insinuate that in some measure the humble books
that I have from time to time written, and the conversations I have held
with your supreme self and with others, are responsible for what is now
taking place in France, Flanders, and the Eastern seat of war. This
insinuation I must with all my strength repudiate. It is true that I
have been an advocate of war. For the Germans it was necessary that war
should be the object of their policy in order that when the hour struck
they might be able to attack their foes under the most favourable
conditions and conquer them in the shortest possible time. But in saying
this I made myself merely the echo of your Majesty's speeches and the
faithful interpreter of your august mind. When you in words of matchless
eloquence spoke of the mailed fist and bade your recruits shoot their
parents rather than disobey their Kaiser, a humble General like myself
could not go far wrong if he supposed that the thought of war was
constantly in your Imperial mind. No other nation, I knew, had the
purpose of attacking us, and I assumed therefore that if we were to gain
the world-power at which we aimed we must be ready to attack other
nations. Everything, however depended on the conditions and the moment.</p>

<p>As for a war begun, as this war was begun, in a sudden fit of temper, I
must use frankness with your Majesty and say that I never contemplated
it. War against France&mdash;yes; and war against Russia, if needs must be,
though even then I deny that we ought to have made ourselves the mere
instrument of Austrian ambitions and allowed ourselves to be dragged
into danger for the <i>beaux yeux</i> of the Ballplatz. But to manage things
so ill as to make it certain that England must declare against us and
that Italy must refuse to help us&mdash;this, indeed, was the master-stroke
of stupidity. Your Majesty will, no doubt, say that this was the fault
of <span class="smcap">Bethmann-Hollweg</span> and <span class="smcap">von Jagow</span>, but I am not sure that you yourself
must not share with them the responsibility, for it was you who lost
your head and gave the final word&mdash;which, of course, no one else could
have given. You could have spared Belgium and kept England out of the
war, so as to deal with her alone at a later date, but you took the bit
between your autocratic teeth, and, alas, there was nobody who could
stop you.</p>

<p>I say again, this is not my war. I never imagined it or planned it in
this way, and I decline to be made responsible for it. I wanted a war
that might be quickly prosperous and as safe for Germany as any war can
be&mdash;a war of which we might keep the management in our own hands with
great profit to ourselves. But now, though only four months have passed,
we have lost the reins and Fate has taken them up and is directing the
course of things. When that happens anything may happen. It is useless,
therefore, to turn round and make accusations which are not founded in
reason. My system was a good one and is still good, but it cannot now be
used. There is nothing for it now except to continue hammering with our
heads against a stone wall, which is not an agreeable occupation even
when the heads are German.</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

<center>VIII.</center>

<p>Dear Charles,&mdash;We have got a move on at last. We don't know where we are
going or why we are going or even if we are really going at all. It may
be that we are on our way to the Continent; it may be that we are on our
way to the coast to assume the defensive; it may be that the authorities
are pulling our legs and are watching from behind the hedges <i>en route</i>
to see how we take it. We march on till we are told to stop. We stop
till we are told to march on.</p>

<p>I was, as you know, in London on Sunday. Having had a trying week I
sought a change of air to recuperate my health, I also sought to recover
my self-respect by being saluted in my native parks. Full of the good
things of this world I returned in the evening to &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>Censor.</i> Now then, don't you give it away.</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i> But, dash it all, he knows where I'd come from.</p>

<p><i>Censor.</i> That may be, but it's not to get about where you are.</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i> But I'm not there now. I'm at &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Censor.</i> H'sh.]</p>

<p>I got to my little nest (anonymous) at 10.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and found the
following among other orders awaiting me: "Company Officers will hold
their companies in readiness to move at short notice." "Will they?" I
asked, and leapt lightly into my bed; never a wise thing to do when your
bed consists of a stick or two and a bit of canvas ... I was collecting
myself on the floor when a corporal came in, wearing that significant,
nay sinister, look which corporals assume when they bring messages from
orderly room. Having cursed him roundly for the collapse of my bed (in
military life you may curse anybody for anything, provided he is an
inferior) I told him to proceed and let me know the worst. "We move at 8
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, Sir," said he. "And what is it now?" I asked. "11.5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, Sir,"
said he. "Then," said I, "I have under nine hours to pack up all my
goods, dividing them into those which I shall carry myself on my
for-light-articles-only back, those which the transport will carry and
those which I shall leave here for Providence to send home; to inspect
my half-company, its feet, its rifles, its packs, its kit-bags and the
thousand-and-one other things which are its; to feed my men and myself
and gather together a day's ration for both of us and to attend to all
those little odds and ends which will inevitably crop up when one is
about to leave one's headquarters and never see them again. All this
must be done by 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> you say?" "The battalion will march to the
rendezvous at 7.15, Sir," said he. "Reveill&eacute; 5.30, breakfast at 6.30,
and sick parade at 6.45," he concluded, adding, with sarcasm more
effective than any of my own, "Good night, Sir."</p>

<p>I went straight to sleep. What else could I do? Obviously the suggested
programme was impossible of completion in the time allotted; why then
attempt it? I decided to obey orders: to reveill&eacute; at 5.30, breakfast at
6.30, and then to start getting ready and continue doing so till called
for. If the worst came to the worst, I should become a sick man and
parade accordingly. It struck me as I dozed off that in civil life the
very last thing an invalid would attempt would be to parade.</p>

<p>In supposing that I should at least be thorough about my sleep, I
reckoned without my old though not always welcome friend, Banner. His
view is that when a crisis arrives it is up to the people involved to be
at least busy, if not worse. To him commotion is essential, and he has
always distrusted our adjutant because the only thing he did on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
receiving telegraph orders to mobilize was to send out an orderly for a
hundred cigarettes and a <i>Daily Mirror</i>. When Lieutenant Banner receives
orders he at once puts his cap on, pushes it to the back of his head and
passes a weary hand across a worried brow. When he has confused himself
to the top of his bent he searches round for other victims. On this
Sunday night ill luck directed his footsteps to my billet; seeing me in
bed, he became positively aghast, though I firmly believe he was
inwardly delighted to discover so depressing a sight.</p>

<p>You may imagine the colloquy that ensued; how he repeated to me, with a
nice sense of climax, the news which I had already received from the
corporal. "It is impossible to do it," said he. "Quite," said I, turning
on my other side. "But good heavens, man, you're not going to <i>sleep</i>?"
he asked. "I'm going to have a try," I told him. The result of the
business was that Banner eventually did all my packing for me, feeling,
no doubt, that I should be left behind if he didn't. Of course he was
left behind himself. Really, I suppose, I ought to be very grateful to
the dear old fellow; but I have the feeling that, if he had stayed away,
I should have had my sleep and every thing would have arranged itself in
the meantime, and would have arranged itself <i>rightly</i>.</p>

<p>We marched forth at break of day from that town where we have been
stationed the last three months, and it shows how unavailing are these
precautions for secrecy when I tell you that the local tailor was up and
about before dawn collecting his unpaid accounts notwithstanding. Since
then we have slept in hay-lofts, and sometimes in eligible villas,
knowing the dignity and pleasure of the white sheet again. Our
willy-nilly hosts are all firmly convinced that we want conversation
confined to the more gruesome experiences of their friends and relations
who have got mixed up in this war, but otherwise they are kindness
itself. At the house I at present inhabit it is found absolutely
essential that the father and the mother, three daughters, two
maidservants, the nurse, and even, I believe, the infant son, should
rise from their beds at 5 o'clock when reveill&eacute; is, at the whim of the
G.O.C., put at that unforgivable hour. It is only myself who may lie
a-bed till six!</p>

<p>Well, Charles, I'll let you know in due course what becomes of me, that
is if I ever know myself. I see little more of the business than the
backs of the files marching ahead of me, and even if I discover the
names of our resting-places I have generally forgotten them in the haste
of our departure. I met a man who had returned from the Continent itself
and I asked him where he had been and how he got his wound. He admitted
frankly that he didn't know; in fact, he said, he'd been back in England
for three weeks now and no one had ever let him know whether he had been
at the front or not. If they don't inform you as to your present or your
past, how can you expect to be informed as to your future? Thus I may at
this moment be marching forward to Belgium, or I may be merely moving to
another home station, or it may all be a test of my power and
organization and I may be making a wide circle which will bring me back
one fine morning to my original starting-place, Tiddilyumpton.</p>

<p>Drop it all, a soldier ought to be told whether he is going to war or
not. It would make it so much easier to know what attitude to adopt to
the schoolchildren who cheer him as he marches past.</p>
<p class="regards">Yours,</p>

<h2>WAR MEMENTOES.</h2>

<p>A thoughtful and far-reaching suggestion toward the better regulation of
the currency has been made by a Mr. <span class="smcap">James Innes C. Roger</span>. He writes to
the Press in the following terms:&mdash;"It has lately struck me that a
silver 10<i>s.</i> piece might be introduced during the war instead of (or in
addition to) the paper notes now current. Although these might be
objected to on the ground of size and weight, they would be interesting
as a memento of the great war, especially if the obverse side bore, say,
a representation of the British Fleet in action."</p>

<p>It seems to us that this would provide a delightful little game for the
Government, which probably has not much else to do at present, and we do
not see how the proposed coins could possibly be objected to on the
grounds mentioned above. On the contrary they would be most useful in a
variety of ways in which the sixpence and threepenny bit are of no
service whatever. In thoroughly honest households they could be employed
as letter-weights or for practising the discus-throw for the next
Olympic Games (if any), or for keeping open a swing door while a
tea-tray is carried through. We hope the idea will be vigorously
followed up. A 15/-piece representing the British Army crossing the
Aisne River under fire would be certain to be popular, as also would a
17/6 piece showing the arrival of the Indian Troops at Marseilles.</p>

<p>Something, too, might be done with our stamps. Concrete gun emplacements
would look very well on the five-shilling stamp, and the desired effect
of secrecy could be obtained by printing them on the back; while we
would suggest for the penny stamp a design of a muffler or a mitten with
crossed knitting needles in each corner. At the same time an important
step could be taken toward popularizing the postal order, by printing on
the obverse side of it in red the whole of the first verse of "It's a
long way to Tipperary."</p>

<p>We only throw out these suggestions for what they are worth. Like Mr.
<span class="smcap">Roger</span> himself our sole idea is to contribute something really useful to
the pregnant deliberations of the hour.</p>

<p>In spite of the drastic regulations against dealing with the enemy it is
to be feared that books from British publishing houses continue to find
their way into German hands. During the early days of the invasion of
Belgium an unprecedented demand for <i>How to Collect Old Furniture</i> arose
in neutral countries, accompanied by enquiries for similar works dealing
with silver plate, pictures and bijoutry. Suspicion respecting the
ultimate destination of these books is strengthened by the fact that of
late the demand has given place to urgent requests for stilts,
wading-boots, and "water-wings"&mdash;a class of goods in which Paternoster
Row is not keenly interested.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The esteemed <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> has recently set itself to discover
the most suitable reading for civilians during the war. One of its
correspondents recommends <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, "in order to learn to
know the English." That weighty point may therefore be regarded as
finally settled. Meanwhile from other sources no less authentic some
interesting particulars have come to light of the literary relaxations
prevailing among our enemy in the field. From these it would appear that
early in September General <span class="smcap">von Kluck</span> received, apparently from an
anonymous admirer, a copy of <i>The Mysteries of Paris</i>, in which he has
been thoughtfully absorbed ever since. His Imperial master's
pocket-companion takes the form of a copy of Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank Richardson's</span>
<i>There and Back</i>, which we learn is already beginning to show signs of
hard wear. Many of the gunners stationed about French and Belgian
cathedral cities are reported as being seriously interested in <span class="smcap">Max
M&uuml;ller's</span> <i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>, while Mr. <span class="smcap">H. G. Wells'</span> <i>Twelve

officials disseminating German wireless news.</p>

<h2>A QUESTION OF LIGHT.</h2>

<p>As soon as Celia had got a chequebook of her own (and I had explained
the mysteries of "&mdash;&mdash; &amp; Co." to her), she looked round for a safe
investment of her balance, which amounted to several pounds. My offers,
first of an old stocking and afterwards of mines, mortgages and aerated
breads, were rejected at once.</p>

<p>"I'll leave a little in the bank in case of accidents," she said, "and
the rest must go somewhere absolutely safe and earn me five per cent.
Otherwise they shan't have it."</p>

<p>We did what we could for her; we offered the money to archdeacons and
other men of pronounced probity; and finally we invested it in the
Blanktown Electric Light Company. Blanktown is not its real name, of
course; but I do not like to let out any information which may be of
value to Celia's enemies&mdash;the wicked ones who are trying to snatch her
little fortune from her. The world, we feel, is a dangerous place for a
young woman with money.</p>

<p>"Can't I <i>possibly</i> lose it now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Only in two ways," I said. "Blanktown might disappear in the night, or
the inhabitants might give up using electric light."</p>

<p>It seemed safe enough. At the same time we watched the newspapers
anxiously for details of the latest inventions; and anybody who happened
to mention when dining with us that he was experimenting with a new and
powerful illuminant was handed his hat at once.</p>

<p>You have Blanktown, then, as the depository of Celia's fortune. Now it
comes on the scene in another guise. I made the announcement with some
pride at breakfast yesterday.</p>

<p>"My dear," I said, "I have been asked to deliver a lecture."</p>

<p>"What ever on?" asked Celia.</p>

<p>"Anything I like. The last person lectured on 'The Minor Satellites of
Jupiter,' and the one who comes after me is doing 'The Architecture of
the Byzantine Period,' so I can take something in between."</p>

<p>"Like 'Frostbites,'" said Celia helpfully. "But I don't quite
understand. Where is it, and why?"</p>

<p>"The Blanktown Literary and Philosophical Society ask me to lecture to
them at Blanktown. The man who was coming is ill."</p>

<p>"But why <i>you</i> particularly?"</p>

<p>"One comes down to me in the end," I said modestly.</p>

<p>"I expect it's because of my electric lights. Do they give you any money
for it?"</p>

<p>"They ask me to name my fee."</p>

<p>"Then say a thousand pounds, and lecture on the need for more electric
light. Fancy if I got six per cent.!"</p>

<p>"This is a very sordid conversation," I said. "If I agree to lecture at
all, it will be simply because I feel that I have a message to deliver...
I will now retire into the library and consider what that message is
to be."</p>

<p>I placed the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> handy and sat down at my desk. I had already
grasped the fact that the title of my discourse was the important thing.
In the list of the Society's lectures sent to me there was hardly one
whose title did not impress the imagination in advance. I must be
equally impressive....</p>

<p>After a little thought I began to write.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wasps and Their Young</span>.</p>

<p>"<i>Lecture delivered before the Blanktown Literary and Philosophical
Society, Tuesday, December 8th.</i></p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Celia, drifting in, "how's it going?"</p>

<p>I showed her how far I had got.</p>

<p>"I thought you always began, 'My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,'" she
said.</p>

<p>"Only if the Lord Mayor's there."</p>

<p>"But how will you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's rather awkward. I shall have to ask the Secretary
beforehand."</p>

<p>I began again.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wasps and their Young</span>.</p>

<p>"<i>Lecture delivered, etc.</i> ...</p>

<p>"My Lord Mayor, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It looked much better.</p>

<p>"What about Baronets?" said Celia. "There's sure to be lots."</p>

<p>"Yes, this is going to be difficult. I shall have to have a long talk
with the Secretary.... How's this?&mdash;'My Lord Mayor, Lords, Baronets,
Ladies and Gentlemen and Sundries.' That's got in everybody."</p>

<p>"That's all right. And I wanted to ask you: Have you got any lantern
slides?"</p>

<p>"They're not necessary."</p>

<p>"But they're much more fun. Perhaps they'll have some old ones of
Vesuvius you can work in. Well, goodbye." And she drifted out.</p>

<p>I went on thinking.</p>

<p>"No," I said to myself, "I'm on the wrong tack." So I began again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Some Yorkshire Pot-Holes</span>.</p>

<p>"<i>Lecture delivered before the Blanktown Literary and Philosophical
Society, Tuesday, December 8th.</i></p>

<p>"My Lord Mayor, my Lords&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to interrupt," said Celia coming in suddenly, "but&mdash;oh,
what's a pot-hole?"</p>

<p>"A curious underground cavern sometimes found in the North."</p>

<p>"Aren't caverns always underground? But you're busy. Will you be in for
lunch?"</p>

<p>"I shall be writing my lecture all day," I said busily.</p>

<p>At lunch I decided to have a little financial talk with Celia.</p>

<p>"What I feel is this," I said. "At most I can ask ten guineas for my
lecture. Now my expenses all the way to the North, with a night at an
hotel, will be at least five pounds."</p>

<p>"Five-pounds-ten profit," said Celia. "Not bad."</p>

<p>"Ah, but wait. I have never spoken in public before. In an immense hall,
whose acoustics&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind. What I mean is that I shall want some elocution
lessons. Say five, at a guinea each."</p>

<p>"That still leaves five shillings."</p>

<p>"If only it left that, it might be worth it. But there's the new white
waistcoat. An audience soon gets tired of a lecture, and then there's
nothing for the wakeful ones to concentrate on but the white waistcoat
of the lecturer. It must be of a virgin whiteness. Say thirty-five
shillings. So I lose thirty shillings by it. Can I afford so much?"</p>

<p>"But you gain the acoustics and the waistcoat."</p>

<p>"True. Of course, if you insist&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>must</i>," said Celia.</p>

<p>So I returned to the library. By tea-time I had got as far as this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Adventures with a Camera in Somaliland</span>.</p>

<p>"<i>Lecture delivered before the Blanktown Literary and Philo&mdash;&mdash; </i>"</p>

<p>And then I had an idea. This time a brilliant one.</p>

<p>"Celia," I said at tea, "I have been wondering whether I ought to take
advantage of your generosity."</p>

<p>"What generosity?"</p>

<p>"In letting me deliver this lecture."</p>

<p>"It isn't generosity, it's swank. I want to be able to tell everybody."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the sacrifices you are making."</p>

<p>"Am I?" said Celia, with interest.</p>

<p>"Of course you are. Consider. I ask a fee of ten guineas. They cannot
possibly charge more than a shilling a head to listen to me. It would be
robbery. So that if there is to be a profit at all, as presumably they
anticipate, I shall have a gate of at least two hundred and fifty."</p>

<p>"I should <i>hope</i> so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two hundred and fifty. And what does that mean? It means that at
seven-thirty o'clock on the night of December the 8th two hundred and
fifty residents of Blanktown will <i>turn out the electric lights in their
drawing-rooms</i> ... <span class="smcap">PERHAPS EVEN IN THEIR HALLS</span> ... and proceed to the
lecture-room. True, the lecture-room will be lit up&mdash;a small
compensation&mdash;but not for long. When the slides of Vesuvius are thrown
upon the screen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Celia was going pale.</p>

<p>"But if it's not you," she faltered, "it will be somebody else."</p>

<p>"No; if I refuse, it will be too late then to get a substitute. Besides
they must have tried everybody else before they got down to me....
Celia, already the Zeppelin scare has shaken your stock severely; this
will be the final blow. It is noble of you to sacrifice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't go!" she cried in anguish.</p>

<p>I gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"For your sake," I said, "I won't."</p>

<p>So that settles it. If my lecture on "First Principles in Homeopathy" is
ever to be delivered, it must be delivered elsewhere.</p>

<h2>&Agrave; LA RUSSE.</h2>

<p>Every November, just as I am beginning to look sadly down the long vista
of apple&mdash;apple-tart, apple-pudding, stewed apple and custard,
apple-charlotte and apple-dumpling&mdash;that stretches all the way from now
to rhubarb, come cranberries.</p>

<p>I had forgotten them, as I do every year, and the pinky-red that tinged
the knife yesterday, as soon as it entered what I feared was an
apple-tart, ran right up my arm and spread in a glow to my face. <i>Dear</i>
cranberries!</p>

<p>And doubly dear just now. How <i>did</i> you manage it? All the way from
Archangel, was it&mdash;threading your way through mines and submarines, and
not a keg broken, not a cranberry exploded? Thank you, <span class="smcap">Jellicoe</span>.</p>

<p>Or are you a Southern Slav, a Crim-Tartar? And did you dare the
Dardanelles, give the <i>Goeben</i> the slip, and disappoint the German
ganders of their sauce? Artful ally!</p>

<p>Where is your home, bright berry? What are your habits? Do you push
through the snow on the steppes? Do you flower in the first thaw of
spring, set in full summer and ripen when the snow falls again? I think
so; you have the savour of snow. I hope so; I picture the snowfields
stained with your blood when you burst.</p>

<p>We've known too little of you, but we shall want to know more now. The
Vicar <i>said</i> the war would do good in more ways than one. <i>It does it
now</i>; it sets me thinking.</p>

<p>Learning, too. My landlady, for whom I had composed a simple
object-lesson on the value of a strong Navy, pricked all my bubbles

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, 23rd November.</i>&mdash;Dull sitting suddenly
stirred to excitement by Apparition in Khaki starting up from below
Gangway on Ministerial Side. It was <span class="smcap">Wedgewood</span> (<i>sans</i> <span class="smcap">Benn</span>). Wanted to
know what advice Government are prepared to give civil population as to
how they ought to behave in event of German invasion.</p>

<p>"Are they," asked the warlike <span class="smcap">Wedgewood</span>, "to take it lying down and let
the Germans walk over them? or shall they make the best possible stand
for their country?"</p>

<p>From above Gangway in neighbourhood of <span class="smcap">Leif Jones</span>' seat came tremulous
voice exclaiming, "Fight!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">

<p><i>Mr. Tennant</i>. "<span class="smcap">Our duty is to drive the invader into the
sea.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>Thus encouraged, <span class="smcap">Parliamentary Secretary</span> to War Office, who day by day
grows more martial in figure and manner, pointed out that "the first
duty we [meaning the Army] and the Navy have to perform is to prevent
invasion. That failing, our duty is to drive the invader into the sea as
fast as ever we can."</p>

<p>As to action of civil population emergency committees are being formed
in counties where there is danger of invasion, and instructions are
being issued by them. What those instructions are <span class="smcap">Tennant</span> strategically
declined to disclose.</p>

<p>After this reassuring statement Consolidated Fund Bill immediately
passed second reading.</p>

<p>Later fresh protest, led off by Lord <span class="smcap">Bob</span> and emphasised by <span class="smcap">Bonar Law</span>,
against arbitrary conduct of Censor in dealing with the Press.</p>

<p>"We ought to stick to this till <span class="smcap">K.</span> caves in," says the <span class="smcap">Member for Sark</span>.
"The Press Bureau has about it stamp of things 'made in Germany.'
Importation of other classes of these goods is prohibited. Let us either
get rid of the Press Bureau or have it remodelled on principles of
common sense, in accord with public feeling and concern for best
interests of the Army."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Stout bundle of Bills advanced a stage.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The ways of the Press Censor are past
finding out.</p>

<p>He worries the British Press day and night. He stands in the way of
recognition of exceptionally gallant deeds on the battle-field by
particular men or regiments. He arbitrarily strikes out passages from
the letters of War Correspondents who, forbidden to approach the
fighting line, laboriously pick up such scraps of information as may
filter through its outskirts. He holds over for days, sometimes for
weeks, official despatches from the Front, for which the Public are
eagerly waiting. Occasionally, by way of exhibiting his desire that not
a moment shall be lost in communicating important information, he, about
midnight, by preference an hour later, dumps down upon hapless
newspapers just going to press the material for whole columns of print.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Solicitor-General knows nothing of seditious Irish
newspapers.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This conscientiously and painstakingly done, he permits certain journals
published in Ireland to circulate seditious garbage designed to stop the
flow of recruiting which <span class="smcap">Carson</span> and <span class="smcap">John Redmond</span>, representatives of
contending national parties, have loyally united in encouraging.</p>

<p>In the Commons the other night attention of <span class="smcap">Solicitor-General</span>, head of
this new department, called to notorious matter. Protested that he knew
nothing of these Irish papers. General impression in both Houses that it
is time he made the acquaintance of the particular organs alluded to and
took action accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Midleton</span> to-night in spirited speech asked what the Government proposed
to do? <span class="smcap">Crewe</span> pleaded that he must have notice of the question. <span class="smcap">Curzon</span>,
ever ready to oblige, promptly undertook to place one on notice-paper.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Commons Budget Bill passed Report stage, <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>
smoothing the passage by concessions to the brewers and publicans by way
of easing burden of additional taxation.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;For some time there has been rumour,
generally discredited, that Prince <span class="smcap">Albert</span>, son of Prince and Princess
<span class="smcap">Christian</span>, had taken active service with the enemy in struggle with whom
the best blood of the nation is being daily outpoured. To-day <span class="smcap">Young</span>
asked whether story was true? <span class="smcap">Premier</span> curtly admitted it.</p>

<p>"Is it considered just and expedient," inquired the Member for
Perthshire, amid ominous cheering, "that the British taxpayer should be
called upon to pay &pound;6,000 a year for the maintenance of a family which
includes this German officer?"</p>

<p>"The Question," replied the <span class="smcap">Premier</span>, with something less than his
accustomed point in dealing with Supplementary Queries, "relates to a
particular individual."</p>

<p>House gladly got rid of disagreeable subject. But <span class="smcap">Sark</span> tells me that,
when in due course the pension comes up in Committee of Supply, more
will be heard of the matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Several War Emergency Bills advanced a stage.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Thursday.</i>&mdash;K. of K. read brief paper on Military
Situation in Flanders. In matter of picturesque detail it did not quite
come up to pitch of "<span class="smcap">Eye-Witness's</span>" despatches from the Front, which in
the main it resembled. But it was as comforting as it was concise.
Summed up in sentence the position to-day of Expeditionary Force:
"Reinforcements have replaced our casualties, and the troops under Sir
<span class="smcap">John French</span>, now re-fitted, are in the best of spirits, confident of
success under their Leader."</p>

<p>Touched lightly on rout of Germans in Poland with which the world is
ringing; but said nothing about capture of <span class="smcap">Kaiser's</span> cloak. <span class="smcap">Sark</span> suggests
that this interesting robe should be put up for sale to highest bidder
(as if it were the First &pound;1 note), proceeds to be contributed to Fund
for Relief of Belgians. This would give opportunity for remarking that
having taken off his coat to devastate the homes of the Belgians,
<span class="smcap">Wilhelm</span> gave them his cloak also.</p>

<p>Suggestion worth thinking about. Certainly something attractive about it
in way of poetic justice.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In the Commons <span class="smcap">Under-Secretary for India</span> gave glowing
account of the gallant deeds of Indian troops fighting in three
continents.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;After heartening speeches by <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span> and <span class="smcap">First Lord</span>,
together going to show that "we've got the ships, we've got the men,
we've got the money too," Parliament adjourned till Tuesday, February
2nd, with promise that, if necessary, it can be specially summoned at
any time on six days' notice.</p>

<h2>A SERVANT OF THE KING.</h2>

<p>"Your King and country need <span class="smcap">YOU</span>."</p>

<p>"Lor!"</p>

<p>Tilda Perkins, her cap awry and a smudge on her diminutive nose, came to
a sudden halt, arrested by the staring blue type.</p>

<p>"Your King and country need YOU."</p>

<p>That personal appeal drove straight home. Tilda's heart swelled; a flush
of excitement invaded her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Bless 'em! They shall 'ave me," she vowed in a fervour of
self-immolation.</p>

<p>Tightly clutching the newspaper containing her master's breakfast
haddock she scudded off, ablaze with patriotic fire.</p>

<p>"There 'tis, Ma'am," she gasped breathlessly, plumping down her burden
on the kitchen table. "An' now I'm goin'."</p>

<p>"Going! Where?"</p>

<p>"To <span class="smcap">King George</span>, God bless 'im. The poster ses 'e wants me."</p>

<p>Her mistress shook a regretful head.</p>

<p>"No, Tilda. It's not you and I he wants."</p>

<p>Gloom unutterable descended upon Tilda as her mistress expounded the
situation.</p>

<p>"Men 'as all the luck," she jerked out. "I ain't surprised them
Sufferajettes got sick o' things."</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"Still, I s'pose it ain't <span class="smcap">King George's</span> fault. I'll 'elp 'im out as well
as I can," she announced.</p>

<p>It was a resolute Tilda who awaited her swain at the kitchen door that
night.</p>

<p>"Take off yer shoes," she said abruptly.</p>

<p>Jem obeyed.</p>

<p>"'Old up yer 'ead. Don't loll," came the sharp command.</p>

<p>Jem drew himself up to attention, and Tilda manipulated an inch tape.</p>

<p>"Sixty-three inches an' a bit. Twelves into sixty go five. Five feet
three an' a scrap. You'll jest do," she said with a complacent nod.</p>

<p>Jem, motionless, but turning a fine blush-rose under the touch of the
busy fingers, levelled an enquiring gaze at the preoccupied face.</p>

<p>"I'm giving you to <span class="smcap">King George</span>," remarked Tilda. "I'm sorry you ain't
taller, but he'll understand I've done the best I can for 'im," she
added with a little sigh.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" faltered Jem.</p>

<p>"There ain't no buts about it," broke in Tilda with swift asperity.
"Think what you'd feel like if you was me."</p>

<p>"Why, it's you a-sendin' me," protested Jem. "I won't go if you don't
want me to leave yer."</p>

<p>Tilda flung back her head with an impatient snort at man's obtuseness.</p>

<p>"You don't s'pose I'm whinin' cos you're goin', do you?" she demanded.</p>

<p>An abashed Jem diminished perceptibly.</p>

<p>"Well, why then?" he asked humbly.</p>

<p>"Cos I can't go, stoopid. It ain't fair."</p>

<h2>A SOLDIER'S SERVANT.</h2>

<p>Dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;I am only a dog, but as you have a dog of your own
you will be able to sympathise with me and understand my feelings. If
you don't, ask him and he will explain.</p>

<p>My master tells me he is going to a place called The Front, and he seems
awfully pleased with the idea. But my mistress is not pleased at all,
though she tries to smile and look happy when he talks about it. All the
same, I have found her several times crying quietly by herself, and have
had to lick her face thoroughly all over in order to cheer her up.</p>

<p>At first, when my master told me he was going to this mysterious place,
I simply barked and wagged my tail and jumped about, because, of course,
I thought I was going there too, and it doesn't matter to me where he
goes as long as I go with him. Imagine therefore my feelings when it
gradually leaked out that I was to be left behind. When the truth dawned
upon me I was so upset that I lay for a whole day on the doorstep in a
dazed condition, whilst several cats <i>who knew me well</i> came and washed
themselves carefully right under my nose. I hardly saw them, though of
course I couldn't help smelling them.</p>

<p>You see, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, what made me feel so very bad was that I had found
out something about The Front from other dogs. It appears that it is a
very dangerous place, full of what they call Germans, where he would
need <i>me</i> to look after him much more than he does at home. Why then not
take me? I cannot understand it at all. I can fight. Ask the dog at the
house at the corner of our road what he thinks, and just take a look at
his ears. They speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Then, again, I can hear and smell a great deal better than my master,
and could keep watch while he is asleep (I am told he will have to sleep
in a ditch!), and after one or two sniffs and bites I should soon learn
to tell a German.</p>

<p>In time of danger the place of every English dog is by his master's
side, and he doesn't mind dying there either. Can't you help us to get
to The Front with our masters?</p>

<p class="regards">Yours faithfully,</p>

<h2>A SPORTING DESPATCH.</h2>

<blockquote><p>[<i>From William Wheezle, K.G. (Keeper of Game), addressed to our own
Subaltern at the Front, and describing the operations of the Allied
Forces in and round the West Wood and the Middle Planting, November,
1914.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to report that on Saturday last the Allied
Forces advanced, as soon as they could be got out of bed, in the
direction of the West Wood. The troops under my command, or supposed to
be under my command, were drawn chiefly from the Old Fogey Division. In
addition to the Household Extremely Heavy Infantry, there were two
battalions of the 160th London Potterers (the "Puff Hards"), specially
summoned from Pall Mall to act with us. These battalions, under the
command of Colonel Bowindow, D.S.O., fully maintained the noble
traditions that attach to their name. There were also two regiments of
unmounted cavalry, the 210th (Flannel Feet) and the 306th Purple Lancers
(Buster's Own). These sections declined to co-operate unless provided
with shooting ponies.</p>

<p>Circumstances unfortunately deprived me of the assistance of other
contingents, such as the Dog-potters, upon which I had in previous years
been able to depend. At Westwood our troops deployed, and a hostile
demonstration on the part of the enemy, signalled by loud von clucks,
kept us thoroughly on the alert. They found our range very quickly, a
good deal more quickly, indeed, than we found theirs; but as they
advanced closer their casualties became more numerous. On the whole the
result of this action was not unsatisfactory. After a short march
through the bracken we occupied a well-chosen position in open country,
our troops availing themselves of such cover as offered, though some of
them took a good deal of concealing. A violent general engagement
ensued, and for some time the firing was continuous. The enemy's losses
were serious, a frontal attack in close formation and at a moderate pace
being attended with great disaster. The Potterers, after taking some
time to bring their guns into action, kept up a constant and, as they
assured me, effective fire.</p>

<p>Reports having been received that the enemy were holding the Middle
Planting in strength, I decided to man&oelig;uvre in that direction. There
was an affair of outposts in the course of the march, Colonel Bowindow
bravely engaging a strongly entrenched rabbit. There was no actual loss
of life, the rabbit retiring in good order, but its <i>moral</i> is, I
understand, seriously shaken if not completely shattered. It
subsequently succeeded in digging itself deeper in, and took no further
part in the day's operations.</p>

<p>Before attempting to dislodge the main body of the enemy our forces took
cover in open order under an adjacent hedge. With scarcely any delay
large numbers of the enemy appeared above the top of the wire
entanglements, the rapidity of their movements taking our artillery by
surprise. Our gunners, however, served their pieces with regularity and
determination until the enemy were reported to be in full retreat. Their
casualties were few, chiefly owing to the speed at which their movements
were conducted, and only amounted to one wounded, or said to be. Two
more were alleged to be missing, but have probably by this time rejoined
their regiments. The expenditure of ammunition during this skirmish was
great.</p>

<p>At the battle of Middle Planting, which followed, the enemy suffered
severely. Our encircling movement was capably carried out and our
high-angle fire was very effective. On our left flank Colonel Buster
found himself at one time almost completely enveloped by hares, but in
this critical situation he handled his guns promptly, and in repulsing
the adversary suffered no loss except that of his temper. That he did
not inflict more damage was, according to his own statement, due to the
fact that the opposing forces, when they saw him preparing to develop
his attack, kept at a prudent distance. During this engagement numerous
wood-taubes were sighted flying over our position, but at such a height
that it was impossible, or appeared to be impossible, to bring them
down.</p>

<p>Rations were then served out, the commissariat being under the able
direction of Major Domo. The quality of the supplies was satisfactory,
nor was there any real shortage, if I may judge from the report
(received by me after lunch from General Torpor, in temporary command)
that our troops were incapable of advancing, or indeed of any movement
at all.</p>

<p>Later.&mdash;On waking up we made a forced march in the direction of Mudford
Village and occupied a wide front, the considerable spaces between units
rendering our operations less hazardous to each other. A flanking
movement upon the line Stubblefield-Tenacre-Turniptops was attended with
some success, though several entire Army Corps of the enemy succeeded in
extricating themselves without disaster. Nor were we able to come in
touch with them again before darkness set in, and the Allied Forces
retired, highly pleased with themselves, to their base, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Auction Bridge.</p>

<center>(<i>A True Story.</i>)</center>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">This War has done many wonderful things;</p>
<p class="i0">It has altered our views of Kaisers and Kings,</p>
<p class="i0">And quite discounted the stern rebukes</p>

<p class="i0">It has hurled from many a lofty pinnacle</p>
<p class="i0">The self-sufficient and the cynical;</p>
<p class="i0">And revised the judgments we once held true</p>
<p class="i0">In various ways that are strange and new.</p>
<p class="i0">For instance, the other day there came</p>
<p class="i0">To see me, the same yet not the same,</p>
<p class="i0">A former office boy, whom once</p>
<p class="i0">I wholly misread as a Cockney dunce,</p>
<p class="i0">Who only cared for music-hall tunes&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">And who went and 'listed in the Dragoons.</p>
<p class="i0">His khaki was much the worse for wear,</p>
<p class="i0">Soiled and crumpled and needing repair,</p>
<p class="i0">And he hadn't unlearned since his office days</p>
<p class="i0">His gruff laconic turn of phrase.</p>
<p class="i0">So I had to drag it out by degrees</p>
<p class="i0">That he hadn't been in the lap of ease,</p>
<p class="i0">But from Mons to Ypres, out at the Front,</p>
<p class="i0">Had helped to bear the battle's brunt.</p>
<p class="i0">Rest? Well, they had to do without it;</p>
<p class="i0">But he didn't make a song about it.</p>
<p class="i0">Last three weeks he'd never been dry;</p>
<p class="i0">A sniper had shot him through the thigh;</p>
<p class="i0">But his wound had healed, he was right as rain</p>
<p class="i0">And anxious to get to the Front again.</p>
<p class="i0">So there he stood, erect, serene,</p>
<p class="i0">Unshaken by all he had suffered and seen,</p>
<p class="i0">And ready once more at his Country's call</p>
<p class="i0">To leave his wife, his home, his all.</p>
<p class="i0">And I, as I thought of what he had done,</p>
<p class="i0">And the arm-chair band (of which I am one),</p>
<p class="i0">Elderly scribblers, who can't even drill,</p>
<p class="i0">And are only good at driving a quill&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">Humbled and shamed to my inmost core</p>
<p class="i0">I wished I could drop clean through the floor.</p>
<p class="i0">For the tables were turned; I stood at zero,</p>
<p class="i0">And the office boy was a full-blown hero.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER MISJUDGED ALIEN.</h2>

<p>Clarence (who pulls the path roller) says there's a Society for the
Maintenance of Horses' Rights. I wish there was one for the Abolition of
Eagles' Wrongs. I am an eagle, the handsomest eagle in the Zoo, and I
sometimes wish I were a sparrow. Moult me, but I've even wished I were
stuffed. And all because the authorities won't change my label. It's
true the notice they've put on my cage telling people to keep their
children from the bars has stopped the young brutes from shooting me
with peas and monkey nuts, but it can't save my feelings, and all
because&mdash;but there! this is how my own particular official label runs:&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Imperial Eagle.<br />
Schodderstoghardtmeissen. &nbsp;&nbsp;Deposited.</span></center>

<p>You can imagine the situation. How in the firmament am I to tell the
public that Schodderstoghardtmeissen is a craggy headland on the coast
of Norway, and not in the least associated with Germany or
Austria&mdash;places I never heard of till but recently. But ever since the
men in khaki first made their appearance in the Gardens some four months
ago a most extraordinary undercurrent of opprobrious criticism has crept
into the public's conversation, that public once so full of admiration
for my noble bearing&mdash;unless it saw me walk; for which reason I don't
come off my pedestal in public hours if I can help it. But now the
mildest visitors seem to hold themselves under a moral obligation to
connect me in some manner with what Clarence calls the "present crisis."</p>

<p>Sixpenny days are my worst. "<i>There's</i> the German eagle!" says the
crowd. I can't even sit in my water trough without being told I'm
"entrenching" myself.</p>

<p>Only last chicken's-neck day (we dine alternately on poultry
and&mdash;er&mdash;the joint) an old lady paused before my quarters and, her head
on one side, murmured musingly: "Yet I always thought the Austrian eagle
had two heads, but perhaps I'm thinking of the unicorn." Half an hour
later a party stopped in front of me, and one of them says: "Them
Jermins didn't deserve a noble-looking bird like 'im to represent 'em,
did they, Hemelie? Something with scales and bat's wings 'ud be more
appropriate, I <i>don't</i> think." "Yes, an' a drunkard's liver," chimes in
another, and then they all laughed. Scr-e-e-e-e-e-ak!!</p>

<p>Even the regular visitors are no better. The stout old gentleman&mdash;an
editor and an F.Z.S., if you please&mdash;who used to get Michael, my valet,
to let him see me from the private window, just glares at me over the
top of his newspaper and mutters, "Hah! my fine bird, you're coming off
your perch head-first before many months are over." And the newspaper
cameraman, who used to take my portrait whilst Michael fed me with
tit-bits&mdash;last week he caught me warming my spread wings in a little
patch of sunlight. "Just the stuff," he twittered, as he struggled with
his camera. "Great wheeze! Splendid snap for a full-page&mdash;'<span class="smcap">His Place in
the Sun</span>.'" It wasn't my fault if I didn't spoil the photograph.</p>

<p>The very latest is a rumour that my right wing is likely to be crumpled
up. And the griffin vulture next door, who saw something of the
sanatorium when he swallowed a lighted cigar-end in mistake for a
glow-worm, hopes they'll give me chloroform. It's also whispered that
I'm moulting, but that, I <i>know</i>, isn't true.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose it must all end one day. As it is, I find myself looking
back longingly to the time when to the public I was just an eagle and a
king of birds. I can even remember with toleration the two simple souls
who once perched upon a garden-seat before my apartments. Said one,
"There y' are, M'ria. <i>There's</i> one of them armerdillers young Bert was
tellin' us about." And the other replied: "Why, don't you know no more
nat'ral 'ist'ry than that, Elfrid? <i>That</i> ain't a armadiller; that's a
'ummin'-bird!"</p>

<h2>TOMMY BROWN, AUCTIONEER.</h2>

<p>Tommy Brown knows all about India. You see his father served out there,
and that is how Tommy knows so much. He says that everybody in India has
to have a bath once a year in the Ganges, and that there is a delta at
the mouth of the Ganges as big as Ireland.</p>

<p>Tommy says it is very hot in the shade in India, but you needn't walk in
the shade unless you like. He showed me how an idol looked&mdash;it is like
when you come to the castor oil under the ginger wine.</p>

<p>But it is about the Indian troops that I want to tell you. Tommy was
very pleased when they came, because he knows all about them. He likes
the Gherkins best, he says, because they are so hardy. Tommy says the
Gherkins can hold their breath for five minutes without going red in the
face, and that's why they can fight so well.</p>

<p>He says they never want anything to eat, because they have a kind of a
twig that they chew, and then all they have to do is to keep tightening
their belts. Tommy gave me some of the twig they chew; it tasted like
cabbage. I didn't want anything more to eat all that day. Tommy had some
himself; he says now he doesn't think it was the right kind of twig.
Tommy told me that the Gherkins' mothers teach them to prowl when they
are very young, and that they are always prowling. Tommy showed me how
to prowl. You have to lie flat on your stomach, and wriggle about as if
you were swimming. He says it makes the Gherkins very hardy. They always
do it, Tommy says, even when they have a half-holiday. To do it properly
you have to breathe through the back of your throat and move your ears.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">King</span> went to India, Tommy says he was surprised at the
Gherkins. They used to prowl before him, and he was very glad. He said
they were very hardy.</p>

<p>Tommy says they are very brave because they don't know what fear is; his
father told him that. He says no one has ever seen a Gherkin blub; if
they have to, they go and do it somewhere else.</p>

<p>There is only one way you can kill them. Tommy knows the way, but he
daren't tell anyone.</p>

<p>Tommy says that when they want to kill a man they prowl after him for
five miles, and then come back as silently as they went. He says it is
no good shooting at them, because they are not there.</p>

<p>He showed me how they killed people. They come up behind you and catch
you round the neck, and it's no good saying, "Shut up," because they
don't understand English; then you make a noise like gargling for sore
throats, and that's how they know you are dead. It makes the people very
angry, Tommy says.</p>

<p>If they take a dislike to anyone, you are sure to get killed, because
they prowl after you until they do. And when you come to look at the
dead man, you can see he has died a horrible death, and if you turn him
over there isn't a mark on him. You see he didn't hear them coming.
That's what Tommy Brown told me.</p>

<p>Tommy says a Gherkin once saved his father's life by killing a snake.
Tommy's father gave the Gherkin a lot of money to put in his pocket, but
he wouldn't take it. The Gherkins don't have pockets, Tommy says.</p>

<p>Tommy says, that if two Germans stood back to back to see who was the
taller, a Gherkin could cut through both of them with his two-handled
knife, and it would be done so quickly that neither of the Germans would
know which was killed first. They do it by practice, Tommy told me. They
always use two-handled knives, so that when they are tired with using
one handle they can use the other.</p>

<p>You can never catch a Gherkin because on the slightest movement in the
bushes they throw a rope up into the air and climb up it, then they pull
the rope up after them.</p>

<p>Tommy says that Gherkins wear turbots on their heads. He says that they
wear very few clothes, but they don't catch rheumatism because it is not
known there.</p>

<p>When Tommy's mother told him that people were sending presents to the
Indian troops we had a meeting about it. We dug a deep trench in Tommy's
garden and held the meeting there; Tommy didn't want the Germans to
know.</p>

<p>When we had dug the trench Tommy stood at one end, and I had to come up
to him and give him the sign we had arranged. You had to move your ears
and say "Gherkin," then you were admitted to the trench. It was because
of the German spies.</p>

<p>We decided to get money for the Indian troops by selling Tommy's white
rats, and I was to lend Tommy my Jew's harp for a week as my share.</p>

<p>Tommy sold the white rats in the playground after school. He stood on a
box near the fence. The man who lives next door thought Tommy was going
to climb over into his garden after a ball, and he said to Tommy, "My
steemy friend, you stay where you are."</p>

<p>Tommy took no notice because his mother said the man had been to India
and brought back his liver and Tommy wasn't to listen.</p>

<p>I bid fourpence for the two white rats; we had arranged that in the
trench.</p>

<p>Tommy Brown said with lots of scorn, "Fourpence!!"&mdash;just like that. Then
he said the money was to go to buy things for the Indian troops, and
what would they think of fourpence? Old Jones minimus said sixpence when
he got his pocket-money on Saturday; then the Head came out to see what
the row was about. When Tommy Brown told him all about it, the Head bid
half-a-crown in a loud voice. We cheered, and just then the man who
lives next door and who brought his liver home from India shouted out
five shillings. Then the Headmaster said ten shillings. Tommy Brown had
to clutch hold of the rails. The man who lives next door went red in the
neck and bid a sovereign. Jones minimus began to blub when the Head bid
two pounds.</p>

<p>The man who had been to India said: "My steemy Sir, it is no use; I bid
four pounds." I could see old Tommy Brown moving his ears like anything.
The Headmaster said: "The Gurkhas are some of the finest troops in the
world"&mdash;he meant Gherkins, but he was excited; then he said: "Five
Pounds, Tommy White, for the brown rats." The man who likes liver said
something we haven't got to listen to, and then Tommy fell off the box.</p>

<p>"Knocked down at six pounds!" said the Headmaster, laughing; "we will
have one each." They both gave Tommy Brown three pounds and then shook
hands over the fence. Tommy says I needn't lend him my Jew's harp now.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</center>

<p><span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>, in one of his Fables, imagines a court presided over by the
Great White Magistrate. It was a very brief session, and the novelist
did not again use the idea. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hugh Carton</span>, whose name, we are informed
by the wrapper of the book, that new and most trustworthy medium of
communication between the candid publisher (unwilling that merit should
shine unobserved) and the hesitating purchaser (who needs only the truth
to send his hand to his purse) is a pseudonym covering the identity of
"one of the leading clerics of our day," has however made a whole book
of it. In <i>The Grand Assize</i> (<span class="smcap">Heinemann</span>) Mr. <span class="smcap">Carton</span> imagines a Day of
Judgment, on which the careers and influences of a number of social
types are weighed and punishment inflicted&mdash;for all are guilty. The
Plutocrat, the Daughter of Joy, the Bookmaker, the Party Politician, the
Musical Comedy entrepreneur, the Agitator, even the Cleric (although
not, I am sure, he of the wrapper) are called to justice. Everything for
and against them is then said, either by themselves or the advocate, and
sentence is passed. The result is a book curiously rich in sympathy,
fearless and fine, and provocative of much thought. That it is in
essence a tract is nothing against it; for many of the best novels
belong to that genus, and <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>, of whom now and then the reader is
forced to think, was a tractarian to the core. I take off my hat to
"<span class="smcap">Hugh Carton</span>" and wish that more parsons were as humane and
understanding as he.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Algernon Blackwood</span> seems as a writer to possess two quite distinct
literary methods. There is his style high-fantastical, which at its best
touches a kind of fairylike inspiration, unique and charming&mdash;the style,
for example, of <i>Jimbo</i>. Then, on a lower plane, there is the frankly
bogie creepiness of <i>John Silence</i>. Between the two he has created a
position for himself, half trickster, half wizard, that none else in
modern literature could fill. His new book, <i>Incredible Adventures</i>
(<span class="smcap">Macmillan</span>), is a combination of both methods. Four of the five
adventures are of the mystically gruesome kind, removed however from
being commonplace ghost-stories by a certain dignity of conception. It
is to be admitted that but for this dignity two at least would fall into
some peril of bathos. Take the first, <i>The Regeneration of Lord Ernie</i>,
in which a young tutor, bear-leading a spiritless scion of nobility
through Europe, brings his bored charge to a strange mountain village
where the inhabitants worship the forces of fire and wind. If you know
Mr. <span class="smcap">Blackwood's</span> work, as you surely do, I need not detail to you what
happens. Told as he tells it, at considerable, even undue, length, but
with a wonderful sense of the mysterious, of the feeling of the
wind-swept mountain and its roaring fires, the thing is undeniably
impressive. But in other less expert hands it would become ludicrous.
There is one tale of finer texture than the others. It is called
<i>Wayfarers</i>, and is a quite beautiful little fantasy on the old theme
that love is longer than life. This is what Mr. <span class="smcap">Blackwood</span> can do to
perfection. It redeems a volume that, for all its originality, does not
otherwise display his art quite at its best.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Antarctic Adventure</i> (<span class="smcap">Fisher Unwin</span>), by <span class="smcap">Raymond E. Priestley</span>, tells the
story of <span class="smcap">Scott's</span> Northern party. That party, as you probably remember,
spent an unexpected winter underground, owing to the failure of the ship
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span> relieve it. Its story was shortly told by its leader, Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Campbell</span>, in <i>Scott's Last Expedition</i>&mdash;the official report of a sailor
to his commanding officer. Mr. <span class="smcap">Priestley</span> is more communicative. As one
of the famous six who went through it, he gives us, from his comfortable
rooms in Cambridge, the full tale of that extraordinary adventure. He
had a good angle of observation in the igloo, for it was he who doled
out the eight birthday lumps of sugar and the other few ridiculous
luxuries which relieved the monotony of seal. He was, in fact, the
commissariat officer. How he must have been loved&mdash;and hated! To what a
large extent also (one begins to realise) the ultimate safety of the
party must have been due to his management. I recommend to boys and
grown-ups a story as absorbing as <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and as heartening
to the pride of Englishmen as the other stories which we are hearing now
from places less remote. For boys in particular <i>The Voyages of Captain
Scott</i> (<span class="smcap">Smith Elder</span>) has been written by <span class="smcap">Charles Turley</span>, a compilation
excellently made from the original diaries; to which Sir <span class="smcap">J. M. Barrie</span>
has written a true <span class="smcap">Barrie</span> preface describing the boyhood of <span class="smcap">Scott</span>. I can
think of no better present for a nephew.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Woman in the Bazaar</i> (<span class="smcap">Cassell</span>), by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Perrin</span>, is a story of the
Anglo-Indian life in which she always moves at ease. It is <i>Captain
George Coventry's</i> first wife, the golden-haired and "phenomenally" (as
the newspaper-men will go on saying) innocent <i>Rafella</i> of the
high-perched Cotswold vicarage, who eventually finds her deplorable way
down to the Bazaar. If <i>George</i> (that beastly prig) at the psychological
moment of their first serious quarrel, instead of threatening and
laughing like a drunken man and reeling back into the room, had reeled
forward and gone into the matter quietly, the entirely virtuous, if
idiotic, <i>Rafella</i> would not have flown into the practised arms of that
unscrupulous barrister, <i>Kennard</i>, who, as everybody knew, had left a
mournful trail of dishonoured wives all over India, his legal knowledge
presumably saving him at once from the inconvenience of marrying his
victims and from the physical violence of outraged Anglo-Indian
chivalry. And when <i>George</i>, now a colonel and on the verge of a quarrel
with the second <i>Mrs. Coventry</i> about a young ass of a <i>tertium quid</i>,
caught sight of poor <i>Rafella</i> at a window in the Bazaar, he was so
genuinely upset that he rushed back to his wife, forgave her (nothing in
particular) and lived happily ever after. Which, of course, is just one
of those things that thrusts the avenging hatchet into the hand of the
Militant.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I suppose that the "culture" (using this word in the strictly English
sense) of Streatham Hill may perhaps be a trifle thinner than that of
certain other suburbs, and, keeping this well in mind, I must try to
believe that <i>Candytuft&mdash;I mean Veronica</i> (<span class="smcap">Hutchinson</span>) is meant for
romantic comedy and is not a one-Act farce hastily expanded by its
author into three-hundred-page fiction form. The plot turns on a not
very serious marital estrangement. <i>C. I. M. V.</i> (she had called herself
<i>Veronica</i> suddenly one day after reading <span class="smcap">Ruskin</span>) decided that she must
have an intellectual companion and (rather daringly) that he must be of
the male sex. So her husband's best friend dressed himself up as a
fantastic and extremely repulsive-looking poet with a red wig and padded
waistcoat and indulged in fantastic rhodomantades in order to
disillusionise her. Well enough on the knock-about stage, of course.
But, if I am to treat <i>C. I. M. V.</i> from the mildly satiric standpoint,
which I fancy that <span class="smcap">Mabel Barnes-grundy</span> would prefer me to adopt, <i>Mr.
Shakespeare Waddilove</i> is rather a big mouthful to swallow, even if I
can accommodate my throat to the supposition that the lady would have
allowed her husband to choose her Platonic friend for her and promise
beforehand to give him a two months' trial. She did come from Streatham,
I know, before she went to live in the country; but still the trams run
all the way from Streatham to Charing Cross&mdash;and that padded waistcoat!
However there are some amusing passages in <i>Candytuft&mdash;I mean Veronica</i>,
and so I shut both eyes and gulped as hard as I could.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Do you know <i>Mrs. Shovell? Violet Ashwin</i> she was, and married young
<i>Charlie Shovell</i>, some sort of a publisher and really rather a nice
fool. She is an absolute dear. Gay and loyal and adorably kind. No, not
a bit sentimental. Shy and yet has a way with her, and, thank Heaven,
not the least bit of a scalp-hunter. We did think that <i>Master Charles</i>,
who was distinctly by way of being a philanderer, mightn't perhaps run
quite straight. But she's done wonders with him. Might I introduce you?
Certainly? Then get <i>Duke Jones</i> (<span class="smcap">Sidgwick and Jackson</span>), by <span class="smcap">Ethel
Sidgwick</span>. She's entirely responsible for these nice people, and for
<i>Lady Ashwin, Violet's</i> utter beast of a mother, and <i>Sir Claude</i>, that
brick of a man and doctor, and insufferable <i>Honoria</i> and naughty
bewitching <i>Lisette</i>, who came badly to grief and was pulled out of a
really rotten hole by <i>Jones. E. M. Jones</i> (<i>M</i> for <i>Marmaduke</i>) was the
fellow who worshipped <i>Violet</i> at sight and was ever after her faithful
dog.... I've put down this book with real regret. I can't help worrying
as to whether there really is such a person as <i>Violet</i> because I might
have the fortune to meet her. Really, Miss <span class="smcap">Sidgwick</span> has an extraordinary
power of making you feel friends (or bitter enemies) with her puppets,
who aren't puppets at all. I've had the bad luck to miss <i>A Lady of
Leisure</i>, to which <i>Duke Jones</i> is a sequel, but I'll readily take the
responsibility of advising you to get it first.</p>
